# Advent of Code 2023
[Calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

Using an alias `aoc` for `python main.py` I can do the following:

`$ aoc init 15` to initialize the biolerplate for day 15.

`$ aoc 15 1` to run the first part of day 15.

`$ aoc 15 2` to run the second part of day 15.

Data is fetched automatically by the script using the aocd library.
Handing in solutions I do manually.
