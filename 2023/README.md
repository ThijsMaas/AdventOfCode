# Advent of Code 2023
Link: [Calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

This year I will be using Python to solve the puzzles. My main goal is not to be the fastest, but to write readable, type-hinted code and provide generic solutions. I wont use external libraries, like numpy or scipy, but I will use the standard library for handy itertools and collections.

## Status:
| Day | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20  | 21  | 22  | 23  | 24  | 25  |

# Tooling:

Using an alias `aoc` for `python aoc.py` I can do the following:

`$ aoc init 15` to initialize the biolerplate for day 15.

`$ aoc 15 1 e` to run the first part on the example input (if I put it in the file)

`$ aoc 15 1` to run the first part of day 15 while fetching the input data automatically.

`$ aoc 15 2` to run the second part.

Data is fetched automatically by the script using the aocd library.
Handing in solutions I do manually.
