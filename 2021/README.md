# 2021

This is my Advent of Code 2021 repository.  
This year I'm solving the puzzles using TypeScript.  
I'm using [Bun](https://bun.sh) to run my solutions.

To run:

```
Usage: bun solve <day> [option]
Options:
    <day>       The day to run [1-25]
    i, init     Initialize the day by creating a new file with template code
    e, example  Run the example input for the specified day
```

Requirements:
- Bun
- A cookie file stored at $HOME/.config/aocd/token containing your session token

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.18.
